# React Native FN Forms Library

This is a pure JavaScript React Native library for intelligent form validation with built-in field-specific validators.

## Project Structure

- `/src` - Main library source code
- `/example` - Example React Native app demonstrating the library
- `/docs` - Documentation files
- `/__tests__` - Test files

## Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React Native best practices
- Implement smart validation for common field types (name, email, phone, etc.)
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (iOS/Android)
- Focus on performance and accessibility
- Pure JavaScript implementation (no native code)

## Key Features to Implement

- Built-in validators for common field types
- Real-time validation with debouncing
- Smart error messages and suggestions
- React Native optimizations (keyboard handling, platform-specific props)
- Accessibility support
- TypeScript definitions
